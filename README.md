#ASCII Replacer Plugin for Sublime Text
This is a simple plugin that takes apostrophes, quotation marks, and ampersands and replaces them with the plain text or html code version of them. Run this so that all those characters show up properly in your file.

##Using it
Once installing through Package Control, you can find ASCII Replacer in the "Edit" menu and the "Context" menu in Sublime. Also, it is set as a default for a key binding:

Windows and Linus: `ctrl+alt+a`

Mac: `ctrl+super+a`

Remember that in Mac, super = command

Highlight the text you want to check for these invalid characters, then use the shortcut or the Edit/Context menu.
